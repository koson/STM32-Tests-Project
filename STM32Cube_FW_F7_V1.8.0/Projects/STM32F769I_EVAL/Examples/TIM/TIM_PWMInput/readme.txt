@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).
SystemCoreClock is set to 216 MHz for STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx Devices.

TIM3 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM3 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle, we use the TIM3 CC2 interrupt request,
so in the TIM3_IRQHandler routine, the frequency and the duty cycle of the external 
signal are computed.

"uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM3 counter clock = SystemCoreClock / 2,
uwFrequency = TIM3 counter clock / TIM3_CCR2 in Hz, 

"uwDutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:
uwDutyCycle = (TIM3_CCR1*100)/(TIM3_CCR2) in %.

The minimum frequency value to measure is (TIM3 counter clock / CCR MAX)
                                         = (216 MHz) / 2 / 65535
                                         = 1648 Hz

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM3 CH2 pin (PB.05).
