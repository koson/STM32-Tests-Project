@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the SAI HAL API to play an audio file using the DMA 
circular mode and how to handle the buffer update.

      Plug a headphone to ear the sound  /!\ Take care of yours ears.
      Default volume is 20%.
      The audio file is played in loop
      @Note: Copy file 'audio.bin' (available in AudioFile) directly in the flash 
      at @0x08010000 using ST-Link utility
Once started, LED1 is toggling on STM32F769I-EVAL.

@note Note the DMA runs in circular buffer mode and never stops. If you break with 
      the debugger, the DMA hw will keep running and a noise will be heard.

@note This example does not use BSP_AUDIO so the MspInit is coded in the main.c.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F769xx/STM32F779xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F769I-EVAL
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.      

  - STM32F769I-EVAL Set-up :
    - Make sure that JP3 is in position 1-2.
    - Plug headset on CN28 connector. 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
