@par Example Description

This example describes how to receive one data byte from an I2C Slave device to an
I2C Master device. Both devices operate in Interrupt mode. Peripheral initialization
is done using LL initialization function to demonstrate LL init usage.

This example guides you through the different configuration steps by mean of LL API
to configure GPIO and I2C peripherals using only one NUCLEO-F767ZI.

I2C2 Peripheral is configured in Slave mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz, Own address 7-bit enabled).
I2C1 Peripheral is configured in Master mode with EXTI (Clock 400Khz).
GPIO associated to User push-button is linked with EXTI. 

LED1 blinks quickly to wait for user-button press. 

Example execution:
Press the User push-button to initiate a read request by Master.
This action will generate an I2C start condition with the Slave address and a read bit condition.
When address Slave match code is received on I2C2, an ADDR interrupt occurs.
I2C2 IRQ Handler routine is then checking Address Match Code and direction Read.
This will allow Slave to enter in transmitter mode and then send a byte when TXIS interrupt occurs.
When byte is received on I2C1, an RXNE interrupt occurs.
When RXDR register is read, Master auto-generate a NACK and STOP condition
to inform the Slave that the transfer is finished.
The NACK condition generate a NACK interrupt in Slave side treated in the I2C2 IRQ handler routine by a clear of NACK flag.
The STOP condition generate a STOP interrupt in both side (Slave and Master). I2C2 and I2C1 IRQ handler routine are then
clearing the STOP flag in both side.

LED1 is On if data is well received.

In case of errors, LED1 is blinking.

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-F767ZI board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - NUCLEO-F767ZI Set-up
    - Connect GPIOs connected to I2C2 SCL/SDA (PB.10 and PB.11)
    to respectively SCL and SDA pins of I2C1 (PB.6 and PB.9).
      - I2C2_SCL  PB.10 (CN10, pin 32) : connected to I2C1_SCL PB.6 (CN10, pin 13) 
      - I2C2_SDA  PB.11 (CN10, pin 34) : connected to I2C1_SDA PB.9 (CN7, pin 4)

  - Launch the program. Press User push-button to initiate a read request by Master 
      then Slave send a byte.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
