@par Example Description

This example describes how to use UTILS LL API to configure the system clock using PLL with HSI as source
clock. The user application just needs to calculate PLL parameters using STM32CubeMX and call the UTILS LL
API.

System starts with clock used after reset.
Then, a system clock switch is done to PLL with HSI as PLL clock source. Automatically, FLASH latency
is tuned according to system constraints described in the reference manual.

User can easily set its own PLL parameters in changing global variable used to store them.

A LED1 toggle of 1sec provides this information that system is well configured to requested frequency.  

Anyway, signal on PA.08 can be monitored with an oscilloscope (in connecting PA.08 to pin 8 of PA_PORT) 
to check the requested frequency:
 - SYSCLK frequency with frequency value around @216MHz.

@par Keywords

Utils, system, Clock, HSI, PLL, flash latency, SYSCLK, frequencyn Oscilloscope

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 �Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs�
